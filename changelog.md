## [5.0.1] - 2019-10-10

## [5.0.0] - 2019-10-04

### Updated
- Support for localized routes using `route.draw(app).get(...)`
  * BREAKING: `route.path` now returns an object with `.en`, `.fr`, etc keys.

### Added
- `route.applySchema(schema)` is a middleware that does the schema-related parts of what was formerly `defaultMiddleware`.
- `route.doRedirect()` is a middleware that will redirect to the next route in the correct locale
- `route.doRedirect((req, res) => routeOrName)` is a middleware that will compute the next redirect route, and redirect there in the correct locale.

### Updated
Linting rules + include utils directory
Don't save `redirect` or `csrf` form data to session

## [4.0.0] - 2019-10-01

Additional properties added:

- route.next
- route.prev

```
app
    .get(route.path, (req, res) => {
      res.render(route.name, routeUtils.getViewData(req))
    })
    .post(
      route.path,
