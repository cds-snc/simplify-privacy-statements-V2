- `route.doRedirect()` is a middleware that will redirect to the next route in the correct locale
- `route.doRedirect((req, res) => routeOrName)` is a middleware that will compute the next redirect route, and redirect there in the correct locale.

Linting rules + include utils directory
Don't save `redirect` or `csrf` form data to session

```
app
    .get(route.path, (req, res) => {
      res.render(route.name, routeUtils.getViewData(req))
    })
    .post(
      route.path,
      route.defaultMiddleware({ schema: Schema }),
