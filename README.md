## Proof of Concept - Simplify Privacy Statements



Privacy is a complex policy area and is often used to shut down crucial user research or testing. Let's take the guess-work out of creating privacy and consent (P&C) notices for designers and researchers - maybe even for the entire government of Canada. Just as VAC has a logic to their benefits, so does a privacy and consent form. Let's create a tool that automatically generates P&C notices so that policy doesn't have to keep holding up the show.

_Mission Statement:_ Help CDS research and design spend more time with users, and less time fighting the bureaucracy.

_Goal:_ A working prototype that generates P&C statements.
